# Numbers

Numbers are values that can be used in mathematical operations. 
You donâ€™t need any special syntax for numbers â€” just write them straight into JavaScript.

    > 12345;

Numbers can be integers, like 2, 14, or 4353, or they can be decimals, also known as floats, like 3.14, 1.5, or 100.7893423.

JavaScript doesnâ€™t distinguish between whole numbers and decimals, so you can use them together without having to convert from one to the other.

    > 10 + 3.14159;
    13.14159

We can also see that we have done our first math **operation** in JavaScript.
We can use JavaScript to do all kinds of calculations!

We can also store the result of an operation into a variable

    > var ten = 10;
    > ten + 10
    20
