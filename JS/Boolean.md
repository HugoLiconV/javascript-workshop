# Boolean

Booleans are values that can be only one of two things: `true` or `false`.

Anything “on” or “off,” “yes” or “no,” or temporary is a usually good fit for a boolean.

As all other types boolean values can be stored inside variables

    > var truthy = true
    > a
    true

They can also be created through a boolean *operation*

    > 1 == 2
    false

We just used a *equal to* (`==`) operator. This type is called a **comparison operator** and we'll look more into them later on!
